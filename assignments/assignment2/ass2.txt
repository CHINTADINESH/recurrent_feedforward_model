It is waste of computation,time and memory to train a network everytime we need to predect something
If it is possible to store a network some where after we trained it ,it potentially saves resources
Task is to find if there are ways to save a network so that we can start if from there instead of stating it over.
Network to be stored is the previous assignment network.
