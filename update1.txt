We have been explorative and found some possibilities of applications of AI.
After going through some papers and websites we noted that the concepts are not so abstract and are very comprihensive.

For any analysis to be done data is very essential and i felt the need for data acquisition and web scraping techniques.I can now 

	1)extract any text data,tables available online.Still working on scrapping histograms,picharts etc
	2)store dynamic data in real time
